# UndertaleSaveEditor
Simple program by a simple person for simple people to simplify editing Undertale save files. Simple.

This project is compiled with Qt 5.5.1 using STATIC linking, because I don't like having library files hanging loose from my executables.
I'm not sure if it works with older versions, since I recall using functions introduced in version 5.5.1

If you, for some reason, want to compile this yourself, just open the ".pro" file with Qt Creator. Or use any method you like, this is just the way I do it.

Right now it's a mess. I intend to cleanup the code, replace images with some my own artwork and something else I'm most likely forgetting.
