# UndertaleSaveEditor
Simple program by a simple person for simple people to simplify editing Undertale save files. Simple.

>If you're just looking for the executable (.exe file): You'll find it in the **[release](/release/)** folder.

##### The executable has been tested on following operating systems:
* Windows 10 (x64): Working
* Windows 7 SP1 (x86): Working
* Windows XP SP3 (x86): "Not a Valid Win32 Application"
* Ubuntu 15.10 with Wine 1.8-rc3: Working, but unstable and slow.

##### Some thoughts on compiling  
If you, for some reason, want to compile this yourself, just open the ".pro" file with Qt Creator. Or use any method you like, that's just the way I do it.  
For this project I used Qt 5.5.1 with STATIC linking, because I don't like having library files hanging loose from my executables.  
I'm not sure if it works with older versions, since I recall using functions introduced in version 5.5.1  

***
Right now it's a mess. I intend to cleanup the code, replace images with some my own artwork and do something else I'm most likely forgetting.
