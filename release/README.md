###Pre-compiled executable version 0.1  
Should be working without problems. Thanks to MinGW.  
Using compiler from Visual Studio caused more trouble than it was worth.  
#### Tested on following operating systems:

Operating System | Status

* Windows 10 (x64)|**Working**
* Windows 8 (x64)|**Working**
* Windows 7 SP1 (x64)|**Working**
