###Pre-compiled executable version 0.0  
The source is updated to version 0.1, but for some reason the new executable is missing some .dll files.  
When this problem is solved the new executable will be uploaded.

###In case of errors
MSVCP120.dll is missing: Installing *Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013* (vcredist_x86.exe) seems to fix this. You can get it from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).
